<p>Nowadays customers are increasingly looking for ways to obtain insights from all their data. Volume, speed and complexity of data now defeats traditional analytics tools, that’s why more and more customers now realize that traditional approaches in conjunction with Business Intelligence are not enough. While <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> addresses <strong>descriptive</strong> and <strong>diagnostic analysis</strong>, <strong>Data Science</strong> unlocks new opportunities through <strong>predictive</strong> and <strong>prescriptive analysis</strong>. This causes a high demand for solutions using Data Science and Machine Learning in a near-real time that can adapt to a rapidly changing environment, that can work « at the edge » (i.e. directly on the sensors’ side, thanks to “Edge Computing”).</p>
<p>Through various Labs, we are going to focus on an innovative part consisting in working with <strong>devices “at the edge” with Machine Learning processing, in near-real time. All disconnected from the Cloud, but with a Cloud management and supervision</strong> as soon as the connectivity is back.</p>

---
The Labs are based on true example of Drones transporting parcels, but with simplified assumptions to ease the understanding. The Drones has to take decisions real-time based on its sensors, and the telemetry sent to the Cloud will help predict maintenance time.
