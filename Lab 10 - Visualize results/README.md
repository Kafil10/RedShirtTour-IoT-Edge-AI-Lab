## Visualize results



One of the ways to view model results is to use an Azure Time Series Insights service.

The advantages of using Azure Time Series Insights include:

路 Validation and monitoring of IoT solutions in minutes

路 Intuitive visualization and analysis of IoT data

路 Accelerate analysis and anomaly detection

路 A global view of multiple data sources

To get started with Time Series Insights and to visualize model application results, we need:

1. Create a Time Series Insights environment in the Azure portal.

2. Go to resource and set data access policies to users.

3. Set IoT Hub used for IoT Edge as a new event source.

4. Go to the environment and visualize model prediction results.

5. The Time Selection Panel can be used to select a time interval, you can select the time gap between two periods using drag-n-select or use one of the controls above the chart. After you have to hit the button "Search".

6. The term panel contains your search terms. For now, you have a search term showing the number of events over time. Clicking on "Add" will add an additional term.

7. The line graph contains the visualizations from your search terms. You can do a lot of things with the line graph, including filtering, pinning, sorting, and stacking. To explore the data, select a period using drag-n-select, then right-click the selected region and click Explore Events.

8. The grid contains a table of data for the period you have selected. You can also change columns visibility, download grid data, and view statistics about each column's values by clicking "STATS".

9. By modifying the terms, you can modify the projected values in the space of the chart visualization.

10. By adding another term, you can correlate the different line charts.

11. You can filter the series shown in the visualization using input box.

12. You can copy the URL at any time and send it to someone to share the new created view.

13. In addition, you can do a few queries and, therefore, make many workspaces.
